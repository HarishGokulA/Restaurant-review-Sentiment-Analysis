rajvi,Bologna,A must visit for authentic Italian food! The food here is simply amazing. The staff is attentive and courteous. They started us off with their complimentary bread and flavoured butter. The bread was warm and fresh. It went really well with the butter. From then on we knew we were in for a treat. We ordered: 1. Spinach and cheese ravioli (9/10) - The pasta was thin with a good amount of filling. The burnt butter and sage sauce took the dish to the next level.2. Pesto chicken bruschetta (10/10) - The chicken was perfectly flavoured with pesto and was served with a toasty bruschetta. 3. Dolce della casa (10/10) - The sponge cake was fresh. It had soaked up that lovely chocolate sauce. The dessert was not overly sweet and well balanced. I would definitely recommend this place. I look forward to visiting the restaurant again to try their other dishes.,5,Zomato
